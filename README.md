# Data Augmentation for Machine Learning
This repository provides a collection of data augmentation techniques for machine learning tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and more. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your training dataset by applying transformations to existing data, helping prevent overfitting and improving model generalization.

# Features
### Image Augmentation: Includes techniques such as rotation, flipping, cropping, scaling, color jitter, and more.
### Text Augmentation: Provides basic augmentations for NLP tasks, like random word substitutions and paraphrasing.
### Audio Augmentation: Implements techniques for augmenting audio datasets, such as adding noise, pitch shifting, and time-stretching.
### Custom Augmentation Pipelines: Create custom augmentation pipelines tailored to specific use cases.
